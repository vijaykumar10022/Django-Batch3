Models:
->in models.py we will create one or more classes
->here each and every class represents a db table
->in this class each field maps a db column
->to convert class into db table we have two commands
    1) python manage.py makemigrations
          ->this command will generate interface file for class to 
             db table
    2) python manage.py migrate
         ->this command will create db tables by using generated 
            interface file
